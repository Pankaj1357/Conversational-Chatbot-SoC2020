# Conversational-Chatbot-SoC2020
# Conversational-Chatbot-SoC2020Work done during WNCC-SoC 2020&lt;h3> For training the bot run file "train_bot.py" &lt;/h3>&lt;h3> To talk to or chat with the bot for evaluation run file "talk_to_bot.py" &lt;/h3>&lt;p> On running "talk_to_bot.py" we will be presented with two options. Either we can have chat with the bot (i.e. keyboard input and output) or we can talk to the bot (i.e. audio input and keyboard+audio output). &lt;/p>
